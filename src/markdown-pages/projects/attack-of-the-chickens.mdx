## GameBoy Advance

'Attack of the Chickens' was created during my first year at university for the module titled 'Computer Graphics Architecture'.
The game is for the GameBoy Advance and was programmed in c++. It is a 2D top-down survival shooter where you play as a chicken
trying to fend off waves of evil chickens who are after your prized golden egg.
There is also sound in the game which was not taught in the module, I just enjoy a challenge!

You can download the game <a href="/assets/projects/attack-of-the-chickens/attack_of_the_chickens.gba">here</a>.
You will need an emulator like <a href="http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/gba/vboyadvance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Boy Advance</a> in order to play it.
