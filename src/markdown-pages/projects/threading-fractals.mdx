An application to demonstrate threading was developed during my second year at university for the module titled 'Computer Operating Environments'.
The application was created with Visual Studio 2010 in c++ using SFML to render the graphics and the Boost library for the threading.
Threading is used to speed up the calculation and rendering of three fractals: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set" target="_blank">Mandlebrot</a>,
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbulb" target="_blank">Mandlebulb</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhabrot" target="_blank">Buddhabrot</a>.
