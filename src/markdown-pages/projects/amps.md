AMPS is a vibrant 2D neon platformer developed by students from Abertay University for PC and PS4 using the Sony PhyreEngine and had been in development since January 2015.
Starting out as a third year group project, development was continued throughout summer and AMPS was showcased at the Dare Indie Showcase 2015 in Dundee.
I was given the responsibility to implement an interface to allow us to render our own in-game graphics and created three rendering tutorials for the Sony PhyreEngine.</p>
